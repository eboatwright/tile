!!! DISCLAIMER !!!
	This editor is made mainly for my own use. It is not very user-friendly!

Hold shift and press S to save
Click and drag the middle mouse button to view
Left click to draw tiles
Right click to erase tiles
Q and W to select the current tile
A and S to select the current layer

The editor will automatically load a file named current.tilemap, and tileset.png
If there's not a file named current.tilemap an empty one will be created
Check example.tilemap for instruction on making files
